# Advent of Code 2015

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2015 in Python.

**Running**
----------------------------------
Single day:

    python run.py -d <day_number>

Single day with custom input file:

    python run.py -d <day_number> -f <file>

All days:

    python run.py -a

Each run prints the results for parts 1 and 2 respectively followed by the total runtime of both parts.
